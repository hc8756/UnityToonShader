# UnityToonShader
This project builds on my basic shader in order to build a toon shader. Its only additional features are a ramp texture and outlines generated by applying a sobel filter to the camera depth texture to post process. This project was created for a [web build](https://ashley-cho.itch.io/urp-toon-shader-demo), so building for other platforms may take a few adjustments.
